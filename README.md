I developed a feature-rich MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) chat web application using Socket.IO. The
 application includes secure user authentication with login and signup features, employing MongoDB for data storage. I
 implemented a responsive UI using Chakra UI, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.
 â€¢ The chat functionality supports both one-on-one and group conversations, allowing users to create and participate in
 group chats dynamically. Socket.IO facilitates real-time communication, enabling instant message delivery and updates.
